This repository contains the code and configuration for this project.

## About the project
It is a hard reality that people with discapacities cannot carry out some tasks.
Nowadays, technology advances by leaps and bounds, however, this increase of it
is not used for helping people, in the mayority of cases.

Because of this, this project pretends to use technology to help them using
the Microsoft mixed-reality device, Microsoft HoloLens. It allows to identify
surfaces so that a person with blindness can move through a room.
